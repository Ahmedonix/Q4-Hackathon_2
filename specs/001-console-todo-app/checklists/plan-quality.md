# Plan Quality Checklist: Console Todo Application

**Purpose**: Validate implementation plan completeness and quality before proceeding to task creation
**Created**: 2026-01-02
**Feature**: [Link to plan.md](plan.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Plan addresses all user stories from specification
- [x] Technical context is complete with language, dependencies, and constraints
- [x] Architecture follows separation of concerns principle
- [x] Project structure is clearly defined with file organization

## Architecture Validation

- [x] In-memory architecture decision documented with trade-offs
- [x] Command-based interface decision documented with rationale
- [x] Error handling strategy defined
- [x] Data model aligns with specification requirements
- [x] State management approach clearly described

## Implementation Feasibility

- [x] All 5 core features (Add, View, Update, Delete, Complete) are addressable
- [x] Architecture supports all functional requirements from spec
- [x] Project structure enables modular development
- [x] Technology choices align with constraints (Python stdlib only)

## Future Scalability

- [x] Design allows for future phases (web API, AI integration)
- [x] Separation of concerns supports layer extraction
- [x] Architecture decisions don't block future enhancements
- [x] Code organization follows clean code principles

## Quality Assurance

- [x] Error handling strategy addresses edge cases from spec
- [x] Testing approach defined (manual validation against success criteria)
- [x] Validation checklist created for plan review
- [x] Plan aligns with constitution principles

## Notes

- Plan is ready for task creation phase
- All architectural decisions documented with rationale
- Implementation path is clear and achievable
